              <li>
                You agree to pay all Subscription fees and charges that are
                attributable to your account on the webiste and that you are

                If you have specifically authorized us, then the payments for
                the applicable Subscriptions are automatically charged at the

                authorization or submit a cancellation request to us directly
                through your account prior to the start of the billing period or
                in writing via email to the address specified in the
